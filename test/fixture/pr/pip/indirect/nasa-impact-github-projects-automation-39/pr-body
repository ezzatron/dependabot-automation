<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/tartley/colorama/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst">colorama's changelog</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>0.4.6 Current release</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://redirect.github.com/tartley/colorama/pull/139">tartley/colorama#139</a> Add alternative to 'init()',
called 'just_fix_windows_console'. This fixes many longstanding problems
with 'init', such as working incorrectly on modern Windows terminals, and
wonkiness when init gets called multiple times. The intention is that it
just makes all Windows terminals treat ANSI the same way as other terminals
do. Many thanks the njsmith for fixing our messes.</li>
<li><a href="https://redirect.github.com/tartley/colorama/pull/352">tartley/colorama#352</a> Support Windows 10's ANSI/VT
console. This didn't exist when Colorama was created, and avoiding us
causing havok there is long overdue. Thanks to segeviner for the initial
approach, and to njsmith for getting it merged.</li>
<li><a href="https://redirect.github.com/tartley/colorama/pull/338">tartley/colorama#338</a> Internal overhaul of package
metadata declaration, which abolishes our use of the now heavily
discouraged setuptools (and hence setup.py, setup.cfg and MANIFEST.in), in
favor of hatchling (and hence pyproject.toml), generously contributed by
ofek (author of hatchling). This includes dropping support Python3.5 and
3.6, which are EOL, and were already dropped from setuptools, so this
should not affect our users.</li>
<li><a href="https://redirect.github.com/tartley/colorama/pull/353">tartley/colorama#353</a> Attention to detail award to
LqdBcnAtWork for a spelling fix in demo06
0.4.5</li>
<li>Catch a racy ValueError that could occur on exit.</li>
<li>Create README-hacking.md, for Colorama contributors.</li>
<li>Tweak some README unicode characters that don't render correctly on PyPI.</li>
<li>Fix some tests that were failing on some operating systems.</li>
<li>Add support for Python 3.9.</li>
<li>Add support for PyPy3.</li>
<li>Add support for pickling with the <code>dill</code> module.</li>
</ul>
