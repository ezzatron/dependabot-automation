<h2>runc 1.1.5 -- &quot;囚われた屈辱は　反撃の嚆矢だ&quot;</h2>
<p>This is the fifth patch release in the 1.1.z series of runc, which fixes
three CVEs found in runc.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>CVE-2023-25809 is a vulnerability involving rootless containers where
(under specific configurations), the container would have write access
to the /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/... cgroup hierarchy. No other
hierarchies on the host were affected. This vulnerability was
discovered by Akihiro Suda.

</li>
<li>
<p>CVE-2023-27561 was a regression which effectively re-introduced
CVE-2019-19921. This bug was present from v1.0.0-rc95 to v1.1.4. This
regression was discovered by <a href="https://github.com/Beuc"><code>@​Beuc</code></a>.

</li>
<li>
<p>CVE-2023-28642 is a variant of CVE-2023-27561 and was fixed by the same
patch. This variant of the above vulnerability was reported by Lei
Wang.

</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, the following other fixes are included in this release:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fix the inability to use <code>/dev/null</code> when inside a container. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/3620">#3620</a>)</li>
<li>Fix changing the ownership of host's <code>/dev/null</code> caused by fd redirection
(a regression in 1.1.1). (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/3674">#3674</a>, <a href="https://redirect.github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/3731">#3731</a>)</li>
<li>Fix rare runc exec/enter unshare error on older kernels, including
CentOS &lt; 7.7. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/3776">#3776</a>)</li>
<li>nsexec: Check for errors in <code>write_log()</code>. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/3721">#3721</a>)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Security</h3>
<p>The following CVEs were fixed in this release:</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vpvm-3wq2-2wvm">CVE-2023-27561</a> was a regression in our protections against tricky <code>/proc</code>
and <code>/sys</code> configurations (where the container mountpoint is a symlink)
causing us to be tricked into incorrectly configuring the container, which
effectively re-introduced <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fh74-hm69-rqjw">CVE-2019-19921</a>. This regression was present
from v1.0.0-rc95 to v1.1.4 and was discovered by <a href="https://github.com/Beuc"><code>@​Beuc</code></a>. (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/3785">#3785</a>)</p>

<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-g2j6-57v7-gm8c">CVE-2023-28642</a> is a different attack vector using the same regression
as in <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vpvm-3wq2-2wvm">CVE-2023-27561</a>. This was reported by Lei Wang.</p>
