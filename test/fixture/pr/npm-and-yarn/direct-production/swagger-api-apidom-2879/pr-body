<summary>Release notes</summary>
<p><em>Sourced from <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases">react-redux's releases</a>.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<h2>v8.1.1</h2>
<p>This bugfix release tweaks the recent lazy context setup logic to ensure a single React context instance per React version, and removes the recently added RTK peerdep to fix an issue with Yarn workspaces.</p>
<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>React Context Singletons</h3>
<p>React Context has always relied on reference identity.  If you have two different copies of React or a library in a page, that can cause multiple versions of a context instance to be created, leading to problems like the infamous &quot;Could not find react-redux context&quot; error.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v8.1.0">v8.1.0</a>, we reworked the internals to lazily create our single <code>ReactReduxContext</code> instance to avoid issues in a React Server Components environment.</p>
<p>This release further tweaks that to stash a single context instance per React version found in the page, thus hopefully avoiding the &quot;multiple copies of the same context&quot; error in the future.</p>
