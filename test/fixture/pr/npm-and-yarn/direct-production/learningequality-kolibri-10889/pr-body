<blockquote>
<h2>v8.1.1</h2>
<p>This bugfix release tweaks the recent lazy context setup logic to ensure a single React context instance per React version, and removes the recently added RTK peerdep to fix an issue with Yarn workspaces.</p>
<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>React Context Singletons</h3>
<p>React Context has always relied on reference identity.  If you have two different copies of React or a library in a page, that can cause multiple versions of a context instance to be created, leading to problems like the infamous &quot;Could not find react-redux context&quot; error.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releases/tag/v8.1.0">v8.1.0</a>, we reworked the internals to lazily create our single <code>ReactReduxContext</code> instance to avoid issues in a React Server Components environment.</p>
<p>This release further tweaks that to stash a single context instance per React version found in the page, thus hopefully avoiding the &quot;multiple copies of the same context&quot; error in the future.</p>

<h2>v8.1.0</h2>
<p>This <strong>feature release</strong> adds new development-mode safety checks for common errors (like poorly-written selectors), adds a workaround to fix crash errors when React-Redux hooks are imported into React Server Component files, and updates our hooks API docs page with improved explanations and updated links.</p>
<h2>Changelog</h2>
<h3>Development Mode Checks for <code>useSelector</code></h3>
<p>We've had a number of users tell us over time that it's common to accidentally write selectors that have bad behavior and cause performance issues.  The most common causes of this are either selectors that unconditionally return a new reference (such as <code>state =&gt; state.todos.map()</code> without any memoization ), or selectors that actually return the <em>entire</em> root state ( <code>state =&gt; state</code> ).</p>
<p>We've updated <code>useSelector</code> to add safety checks in development mode that warn if these incorrect behaviors are detected:</p>
<ul>
<li>Selectors will be called twice with the same inputs, and <code>useSelector</code> will warn if the results are different references</li>
<li><code>useSelector</code> will warn if the selector result is actually the entire root <code>state</code></li>
</ul>
<p>By default, <strong>these checks only run <em>once</em> the first time <code>useSelector</code> is called</strong>.  This should provide a good balance between detecting possible issues, and keeping development mode execution performant without adding many unnecessary extra selector calls.</p>
<p>If you want, you can configure this behavior globally by passing the enum flags directly to <code>&lt;Provider&gt;</code>, or on a per-<code>useSelector</code> basis by passing an options object as the second argument:</p>
<pre lang="ts"><code>// Example: globally configure the root state &quot;noop&quot; check to run every time
&lt;Provider store={store} noopCheck=&quot;always&quot;&gt;
  {children}
&lt;/Provider&gt;
</code></pre>
<pre lang="ts"><code>// Example: configure `useSelector` to specifically run the reference checks differently:
function Component() {
  // Disable check entirely for this selector
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
</code></pre>
