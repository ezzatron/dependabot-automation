<blockquote>
<h2>v3.0.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This change adds a minimum runner version(node12 -&gt; node16), which can break users using an out-of-date/fork of the runner. This would be most commonly affecting users on GHES 3.3 or before, as those runners do not support node16 actions and they can use actions from github.com via <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.0/admin/github-actions/managing-access-to-actions-from-githubcom/enabling-automatic-access-to-githubcom-actions-using-github-connect">github connect</a> or manually copying the repo to their GHES instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Few dependencies and cache action usage examples have also been updated.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating actions/core to version 1.10.0</h2>
<p>The ::save-state and ::set-output are deprecated. The newer version of actions/core &gt;1.10.0 uses the new syntax for save and set output. After this change, customers using actions/cache@v2 won't see deprecation warning message.</p>
<h2>v2.1.7</h2>
<p>Support 10GB cache upload using the latest version <code>1.0.8</code> of <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@actions/cache"><code>@actions/cache</code> </a></p>
<h2>v2.1.6</h2>
<ul>
<li>Catch unhandled &quot;bad file descriptor&quot; errors that sometimes occurs when the cache server returns non-successful response (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache/pull/596">actions/cache#596</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v2.1.5</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix permissions error seen when extracting caches with GNU tar that were previously created using BSD tar (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache/issues/527">actions/cache#527</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>v2.1.4</h2>
<ul>
<li>Make caching more verbose <a href="https://redirect.github.com/actions/toolkit/pull/650">#650</a></li>
<li>Use GNU tar on macOS if available <a href="https://redirect.github.com/actions/toolkit/pull/701">#701</a></li>
</ul>
<h2>v2.1.3</h2>
<ul>
<li>Upgrades <code>@actions/core</code> to v1.2.6 for <a href="https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mfwh-5m23-j46w">CVE-2020-15228</a>. This action was not using the affected methods.</li>
<li>Fix error handling in <code>uploadChunk</code> where 400-level errors were not being detected and handled correctly</li>
</ul>
<h2>v2.1.2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Adds input to limit the chunk upload size, useful for self-hosted runners with slower upload speeds</li>
<li>No-op when executing on GHES</li>
</ul>
<h2>v2.1.1</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update <code>@actions/cache</code> package to <code>v1.0.2</code> which allows cache action to use posix format when taring files.</li>
</ul>
<h2>v2.1.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Replaces the <code>http-client</code> with the Azure Storage SDK for NodeJS when downloading cache content from Azure.  This should help improve download performance and reliability as the SDK downloads files in 4 MB chunks, which can be parallelized and retried independently</li>
<li>Display download progress and speed</li>
</ul>
<h2>v2.0.0</h2>
<p>Initial v2 release</p>
<h2>What's new in v2</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for multiple paths (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache/issues/16">actions/cache#16</a>), glob patterns, and single file caches (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache/issues/33">actions/cache#33</a>)</li>
<li>Increased performance and improved cache sizes using <code>zstd</code> for compression for Linux and macOS runners (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache/issues/184">actions/cache#184</a>)</li>
<li>Allowed caching for all events with a ref (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache/issues/63">actions/cache#63</a>)</li>
<li>Created the <a href="https://github.com/actions/toolkit/tree/master/packages/cache"><code>@actions/cache</code></a> npm package to allow other actions to utilize caching (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache/issues/55">actions/cache#55</a>)</li>
<li>Added a best-effort step to delete the archive after extraction to reduces storage space (<a href="https://redirect.github.com/actions/cache/pull/209">actions/cache#209</a>)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Updating actions/core to version 1.10.0</h2>
<p>The ::save-state and ::set-output are deprecated. The newer version of actions/core &gt;1.10.0 uses the new syntax for save and set output. After this change, customers using actions/cache@v1 won't see deprecation warning message.</p>
